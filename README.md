If you’re looking to get into a career in computer engineering, development, web design, or any other field that requires you to know a certain set of coding languages, you luckily no longer have to go back to school.

The Internet is full of online courses that let you learn new languages in the privacy of your own home. We’ve compiled 10 of the best resources for you to visit to learn your new skills:

Codecademy

Codecademy is possibly one of the most popular online code-teaching websites. At Codecademy, you can learn seven different languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Python, Ruby, and PHP. Once you learn the basic languages, you can move on to more advanced tasks like building a website, making a Rails app, using APIs to make applications, and other fun goals.

Track your progress by gaining points, earning points, and racking up a high day streak. Codecademy is constantly expanding their offerings so expect to see even more from them in the coming years. 

Khan Academy

Khan Academy started as one man tutoring his cousin. Today, Khan Academy teaches people all over the world. Unlike other online resources to teach coding, Khan Academy isn’t limited to just computing courses—you can also learn about various subjects from math to arts & humanities.

Under Khan Academy’s computing courses, you can learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You can also learn computer science basics. If you only have a short amount of time, there is even an “Hour of Code” option.

Coursera/edX

If you like the style of university courses but don’t want to pay the university price, websites like Coursera and edX have compiled multiple different computer science courses that you can take from top schools all over the world. Courses are constantly changing, so if the language you want to learn isn’t currently being taught, you may find a course on it at a later date.

Code Avengers

If you want to learn how to build a website, apps, or games, Code Avengers is the site for you. Code Avengers has over 100 hours of courses teaching you how to build websites in HTML & CSS and games or apps in JavaScript.

Before you even sign up, you can try out the lower level lessons. To help you remember what you learned, you can take notes along the way which will save to your account.

Learn Python the Hard Way

Despite its name, Learn Python the Hard Way really is meant to be for beginners. Learn Python the Hard Way is a book that you can purchase (or try out for free) that gives you videos for each exercise and the ability to continue working whether you’re on- or offline.  

The book claims to be “made for beginners who know nothing about programming. Not a book claiming to be for beginners but really for programmers.”

Mozilla Developer Network

While built for developers, you can still learn coding basics from Mozilla Developer Network. First learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and go on to learn more advanced skills like integrating with APIs or security. Tutorials and references are available to teach you your new skills.

Code School

If you’re not exactly sure where to start, Code School offers different paths that you can follow to build specific skills. If you’re ready to just dive right in, you can also select courses from the full library.

Most of the basic-level courses are free, but in order to be able to take all of the courses that Code School has to offer, you must enroll in a no-contract subscription.

Treehouse

Treehouse offers over 100 courses across 11 topic areas: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Design, Ruby, PHP, WorPress, iOS, Android, Dev Tools, and Business. You will learn from teachers through video, challenges, and quizzes which are all interactive.

If you enjoy the classic live classroom environment with discussions, you have the option to participate in live classes as well as discussion forums with other students. You can try out Treehouse for free for 14 days and then select from two monthly subscription plans.

Udacity

Want to know what companies like AT&T, Google, and Autodesk are looking for in their developers? Get a Nanodegree from Udacity to find out. Udacity worked with AT&T, Google, Cloudera, Salesforce, and Autodesk to build programs around skills that the companies recognize in their fields.

Udacity currently offers five Nanodegrees: Front-End Web Developer, Data Analyst, Introduction to Programming, Full Stack Web Developer, and iOS Developer. If you’re unsure if you’re ready for a program, you can take an assessment before you sign up. Each course can take from 6-12 months to complete, dependent on your schedule. While not the cheapest option out there (the courses cost $200/month), you walk away with a verified nanodegree certificate.

SQLZoo

SQLZoo is the go-to online resource for learning everything SQL. From SQLZoo, you can learn about SQL server, Oracle, MySQL, DB2, and PostgresSQL. Learn from various interactive tutorials and reference pieces and test your new skills with assessments.

With all of these great online resources, the hardest thing will be choosing what to learn first. And once you've become a master of code you can search Monster's openings to find a tech job with your new coding skills in your area.
